# Determine host type
# NOTE: HOST determination on RISC OS could fail because of missing bug fixes
#	in UnixLib which only got addressed in UnixLib 5 / GCCSDK 4.
#	When you don't have 'uname' available, you will see:
#	  File 'uname' not found
#	When you do and using a 'uname' compiled with a buggy UnixLib, you
#	will see the following printed on screen:
#	  RISC OS
#	In both cases HOST make variable is empty and we recover from that by
#	assuming we're building on RISC OS.
#	In case you don't see anything printed (including the warning), you
#	have an up-to-date RISC OS build system. ;-)
