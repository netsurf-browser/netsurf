Name   : SocketWatch
Purpose: Asynchronous socket operations without null polls
Version: 0.07  (11-01-2019)
Status : GNU GPL
Authors: Dickon Hood, Frank de Bruijn

This isn't an official release.

In November 2003 I noticed SocketWatch 0.04y had a couple of bugs. After I had
corrected them and was almost ready to release 0.05, I discovered the
'official' place for SocketWatch was now on the Nettle site
(http://nettle.sourceforge.net). So I contacted the Nettle maintainers, told
them about the bugs and sent them all the work I had done on repairing it,
more or less expecting to hear something about an official release 0.05 within
a couple of months...

Still nothing three months later, so I sent one more e-mail (which remained
unanswered) and put 0.05 on my site.


Installing
==========
The zip archive contains an application called !ModInst. Run it to install the
module on your computer. If you want to install the module manually, you can
find it in !ModInst.Resources.!System.310.Modules.Network.


Source
======
The source code is provided as an ObjAsm file in the Source directory in the
archive. If you want to assemble the module again, run the Build file. The
module will be recreated and moved to the !ModInst application for
installation.


Version history
===============
11-01-2019  0.07
----------------
Catered for errors in SocketWatch_Register better.
Added notes about use with AcornSSL.

12-06-2012
----------
Removed dependency on private library (providing constants) so the source can
be used stand alone. Added Build script (previous builds were done from
StrongED, using a multipurpose ObjAsmRun script). Nothing changed otherwise.
MD5 checksum still f2bb3f8d911d0b20a43d6ee135c3ae97.

23-06-2006  0.06
----------------
Fixed small bug in the AtomicReset SWI (flags not restored in 26 bit mode, so
IRQ bit not cleared). Not sure if this ever bothered anyone (think not as it
was already present in 0.04y).
Removed disabling interrupts in EventHandler as event handlers are entered
with interrupts disabled.
Also some more source clean ups and more comments added.
MD5 checksum: f2bb3f8d911d0b20a43d6ee135c3ae97.

14-08-2005
----------------
Moved the source to ObjAsm. No functional changes to the code. MD5 checksum
still 90f3323981a0e287f488e9a59b2e5373. No new release.

12-12-2003  0.05
----------------
First one by me. Came about when I was investigating a memory leak on my RPC.
MD5 checksum of the module: 90f3323981a0e287f488e9a59b2e5373.

The detailed list of changes below was for the benefit of the Nettle
maintainers and originally sent to Ian in an e-mail on 11-12-2003.
Use the single file source of 0.04y as a reference.

- Most of the variable definitions from Flags% to r12End% aren't required. You
  just need SockList% (with a FNdb(-4) instead of a FNdb(4)) and r12End%. The
  rest was removed.
- No flag definitions are needed. Removed.
- Socket structure definitions and ErrorChunk%: no changes.
- From the module header to EventHandler_GotOne32%: merely some optimisations.
- Error texts: were placed near the routines that use them. This was mainly
  cosmetic, but it had the added advantage of allowing me to replace all the
  FNADRLs with simple ADRs.
- GetBlock%: removed.
- ReleaseBlock%: removed.
- IsHexNum_lp1%: not required. Removed.
- moveBytes%: not required. Removed.
- From title string to SWI-handler: no real changes.
- From Command% to CommandText%: moved the table and the help and syntax texts
  for the commands to just before the SWDL_Code% routine and 'cleaned up' the
  texts a bit, but that qualifies as cosmetic.
- Syslog_Name%: not required. Removed.
- Syslog_Version%: not required. Removed.
- From Init% to FinalCode%: several changes, the most important one being the
  removal of the claiming of a 16K block of temporary workspace which was
  neither used nor released.
  There's also the stacking of r7 to r9/r11. It's true that these registers
  should be saved (according to the PRM) but only if they're modified. So why
  bother if they're not? Replacing this with just stacking r14 enabled a
  'cleaner' jump out of the routines on errors.
  At the very beginning of Init%, I inserted a check for a value in r12 on
  entry. This has to do with re-initialisation after a 'Tidy' operation. Not
  sure if that's still required though (hasn't the 'Tidy' functionality been
  blocked or removed from RISC OS these days or is that an unfounded rumour?).
  I removed everything connected with the CRC-check, including the error text.
  SocketWatch is the only module I've ever come across using something like
  this and I honestly fail to see what use it is here. But if you do see that,
  then by all means leave it in.
  In Final% the (unused) ModuleDying% flag was set, but as that had been
  removed anyway, so were the three instructions involved in this action.
  Actually, as the variable Flags% was re-used to point at the module flags
  word, this flag bit isn't set in the first word of the workspace at all. In
  fact, on finalisation SocketWatch 0.04y sets bit 1 of the word 592 bytes
  from the address r12 happens to point at. That *could* be in the unused 16K
  block that was claimed on initialisation, but there's no guarantee. Nasty
  (and no, I hadn't realised this yet when I wrote the comment on Flags% in
  the Source_004y file...).
  FinalCode% (renamed release%) was more or less integrated with Init% (sort
  of 'glued to the bottom') but otherwise essentially unchanged, apart from
  removing the call to ReleaseBlock% (including the stacking/unstacking of
  r14) in favour of a simple MOV r0,#7 / SWI XOS_Module sequence).
- SWI_Register% contained some code at the start (up to the Bvs instruction) I
  couldn't make sense of. If you can, please enlighten me. I asked Dickon
  about this in my first email to him and he didn't understand it anymore
  either. So I removed it.
  The rest is essentially unchanged (cosmetics only), but I did replace the
  call to GetBlock% and the 'push' and 'pop' instructions around it with the
  MOV/SWI instructions that were actually required here.
- SWI_Deregister%: no changes except for replacing the call to ReleaseBlock%
  and its surrounding 'push'/'pop' with the necessary MOV and SWI.
- SWI_AtomicReset%: optimisations only.
- SWI_AllocPW%: no changes.
- SWI_DeallocPW%: no changes.
- SWDL_Code%: cosmetic changes only.
