SocketWatch
===========

SocketWatch is a simple module designed to reduce the requirement of Wimp
applications using sockets to constantly poll them using Null Wimp polls for
data.

If you're not a programmer, stop reading now, this will probably make little
sense to you.  If you are a programmer, but don't write networking
applications, again, this is unlikely to be of interest.


Rationale
---------

At boot time, my machine loads and runs five seperate applications which
require open sockets.  As none of these have support modules associated with
them, I'm assuming that they are constantly polling the sockets they open on
null polls.  This is inefficient.

Sockets can be marked as asynchronous.  If they are, an Internet event (19)
is generated whenever something interesting happens to them.  Events are only
accessable to modules, however, and are useless in a Wimp environment.  The
answer is to write a module which does that and notifies the parent
application that something has happened.  If every application did this,
there'd be another five or six modules running on my machine, all doing much
the same job, which I don't need.

This attempts to address the issue by implementing a module with an open
interface, and one which is generic enough to be applicable to almost every
app. which could want to use it.


Usage
-----

SocketWatch relies upon a feature of Risc OS 3.1 and upwards, so won't work
on ROS2.  Sorry, but there we go.

Sockets are registered with the module.  At this point, the socket is marked
as asynchronous (so the parent app. doesn't need to).  A pollword and bit
number to set are also supplied.

As some internal structure has to be created, a pollword of 0 is acceptable,
and, if passed, the module will use one of the words in this structure as the
pollword.  This is returned to the app. in r0.

When an Internet event is triggered, the module scans all registered sockets. 
If one is matched, the appropriate bit is set in the pollword.  This allows
other bits to be reserved for other things.  Note, it is not an error for a
socket to have multiple pollwords associated with it; there is no reason I
can think of for two apps. to share one socket (*why* is another matter, but
it shouldn't be an error); these may both register PWs for them.

Usage with AcornSSL
-------------------
SocketWatch should only be used with the normal socket numbers, not the ssl 
socket handles used by AcornSSL.
However, it can be used for secure sockets with a sequence like:
   Socket_Create              to get socket normal socket descriptor
   AcornSSL_CreateSession     to get ssl socket
   SocketWatch_Register       of normal socket descriptor

SWIs
----

SWI SocketWatch_Register (0x52280)

On entry: r0 => pollword, 0 for module to allocate one,
          r1 =  bitmask to set if there's activity
          r2 =  socket number.

On exit:  r0 => pollword.
          If an error is raised by Socket_Ioctl, r0 is => error block
          and the socket is not registered.

If the pollword passed is 0, one allocated from the internal structure will
be returned.  Note that this is freed when at the time of deregistering and
may not be used afterwards.



SWI SocketWatch_Deregister (0x52281)

On entry: r0 =  socket,
          r1 => pollword.

On exit:  all preserved.

The socket is no longer watched.  If the pollword was allocated by the
module, it is not valid once this call is called.



SWI SocketWatch_AtomicReset (0x52282)

On entry: r0 => pollword
          r1 =  new value

On exit:  r0 =  old value
          r1 preserved.

This SWI reads from r0, writes r1 to r0, then exits, all with IRQs off,
making it an atomic operation (ie., one which may not be interrupted).  It is
a problem with Pollwords in that they're used by IRQ or Callback code, yet
read and reset by usermode code which can't disable IRQs easily.  This
removes the problem where the app. reads the PW, IRQ routine sets a couple of
bits, then the forground resets it.



SWI SocketWatch_AllocPW (0x52283)

On entry: -

On exit:  r0 => 4 bytes of RAM which may be released by SWI
SocketWatch_DeallocPW.

ATM, this SWI claims four bytes of RMA; this isn't efficient, and may be
changed in later releases.  The SWI is provided for convenience's sake.



SWI SocketWatch_DeallocPW (0x52284)

On entry: r0 => pollword, as allocated by SWI SocketWatch_AllocPW.

On exit:  all preserved.

ATM this calls OS_Module 7 to free the word.
